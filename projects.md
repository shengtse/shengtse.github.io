# Wave Energy Visualization Software
### The goal of this project is to provide AquaHarmonics with software that will be capable of visualization and analysis of the data provided by the suite of instruments on their scale model wave energy converter. This software will enable AquaHarmonics to continue testing and development of their model. This visualization software produce meaningful data interpreted from the model, as well as display an accurate animation of the model in motion. The visualization will be web based to provide ease of access and flexibility to the user, and to support a variety of packages which may be utilized in the initial analysis of data from the wave energy converter.
