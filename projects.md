#Wave Energy Visualization Software
###The goal of this project is to provide AquaHarmonics with software that will be capable of visualization and analysis of the data provided by the suite of instruments on their scale model wave energy converter. This software will enable AquaHarmonics to continue testing and development of their model. This visualization software will produce meaningful data interpreted from the model, as well as display an accurate animation of the model in motion. Specific data necessary for reporting to the Department of Energy must also be properly calculated and displayed, the particulars on this data and it’s reporting format have yet to be fully disclosed. The visualization will be web based to provide ease of access and flexibility to the user, and to support a variety of packages which may be utilized in the initial analysis of data from the wave energy converter. In addition to these requirements, other features may be added as the project develops to include more complex analytical tools. For example the software may come to support a live data feed so that the team could analyze data in real time while the wave energy converter is deployed.
